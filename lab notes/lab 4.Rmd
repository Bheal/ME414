```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Generally, yesterday's homework was excellent! Well done! Some small things:

  1. Do you actually know what your code is doing?

```{r}
library(ISLR)
Weekly <- Weekly
train <-  (Weekly$Year < 2009)
train.data <- Weekly[train,]
test.data <- Weekly[!train,]

glm.fit <-  glm(Direction ~ Lag2, data = train.data, family = binomial)
glm.probs <-  predict(glm.fit, test.data, type="response")
glm.pred <-  rep("Down", length(glm.probs))
glm.pred[glm.probs>.5] <-  "Up"

table(glm.pred, test.data$Direction)

```

  2. Subsetting, using the `object[]` syntax, can be done using numeric inputs **or** logical inputs
  
```{r, echo = F}
letters <- letters[1:5]
```

```{r}
print(letters)
```

Let's say that I would like subset the vector `letters` to just the first, third, and fifth elements. How would I do this?
